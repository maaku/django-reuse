Reusable applications are the primary strength of Django.  With careful
design, a reusable app can be made such that it need only be added to a
project's INSTALLED_APPS setting and instantly add functionality to a site
without any need for manual configuration.  However the key words here are
*careful design*.  The vision of reusable applications that are easy to drop
into a project and painless to use is only realizable only if certain design
constraints and conventions are decided upon and rigorously adhered to.

This project, django-reuse, provides a suite of scripts and utility functions
that make it easy to build and maintain reusable Django applications.  It also
provides utilities for managing a development environment that makes it easy
manage applications and keep them up to date.
