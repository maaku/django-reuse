$PROJECT_NAME$ is distributed under an open source license.  This means (among other things) that the complete source code is available for your perusal, and you are free to make modifications to the source code or use it in any way you see fit, subject to a few restrictions (see: LICENSE.txt).

It is the strength of community effort that makes open source software truly great.  If you make a change to $PROJECT_NAME$ which may be useful to others please consider sending a patch to the $PROJECT_NAME$ development team (see: AUTHORS.txt) so that your work may be made available to all of our users.

If you wish to help out but are unsure as to what you can do or what needs to be done, read the file TODO.txt or check out $PROJECT_NAME$'s GitHub wiki or Lighthouse issue tracker.  There is also a developers mailing list (see: README.txt) which is publicly accessible, but please try to read all the accompanying documentation and search the mailing list archives before posting.
